A Python guessing game generates a random number within a specified range and challenges the user to guess it. The program prompts the user for a guess and provides feedback, telling them if their guess is too high, too low, or correct. The game continues until the user guesses the correct number. Once guessed, the program congratulates the user and can display the number of attempts it took to guess correctly.
